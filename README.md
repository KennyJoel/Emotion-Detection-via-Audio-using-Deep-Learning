# Emotion-Detection-via-Audio-using-Deep-Learning

Here this is Kuragayala Kenny Joel.
This project mainly focused on Emotion Detection via audio.

Most Individuals experience a variety of emotional states on daily basis. Emotions are very complex to categorize because not every emotion is effectively recognizable. Such emotions are understandable through their voice while some are with vision and action. From a visually challenged user point of view speech is one of the finest means through which emotions can be understood. The proposed project uses a combination of Deep Learning Models to analyze the audio data and classify it into different emotion states.

#Objectives

Building a deep learning model that can accurately classify audio recording.

To address the problem of identification and recognition of emotion detection.
