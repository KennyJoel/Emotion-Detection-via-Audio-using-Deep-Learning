# Emotion-Detection-via-Audio-using-Deep-Learning

Here this is Kuragayala Kenny Joel.
This project mainly focused on Emotion Detection via audio.

Most Individuals experience a variety of emotional states on daily basis. Emotions are very complex to categorize because not every emotion is effectively recognizable. Such emotions are understandable through their voice while some are with vision and action. From a visually challenged user point of view speech is one of the finest means through which emotions can be understood. The proposed project uses a combination of Deep Learning Models to analyze the audio data and classify it into different emotion states.

Objectives:
Building a deep learning model that can accurately classify audio recording.
To address the problem of identification and recognition of emotion detection.


Since speech varies from person to person and has a behavioral impact in understanding of personality. This research work focus using deep learning as a methodology to address this problem of identification and recognition. Able to give high Accuracy than existing deep learning models.
For more accuracy there can be need for huge dataset so here is the following the 4 dataset which I have taken for the project.


Coming to the implementations I have completed several steps in the initial stages of a machine learning project, including preprocessing, data augmentation, model building, and fine tuning. These steps are crucial in developing an accurate and effective machine learning model.

For a good deep learning there may require huge data set. Data Augmentation is also a technique to increase the dataset by changing minute properties of the data in the dataset.

In my project I have Data Augmented the data with injecting some of the external changes in the data. Here are those

Noise Injection : Injection the noise tin the dataset.
Stretching : Stretching the audio file.
Pitching: Increasing the pitch and decreasing the pitch in the audio.
Shifting: Shifting the audio with respective to time.
